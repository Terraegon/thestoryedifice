<p>Hi, everyone! My name is Kaylee, and I like to read, write, hike, and code. I like watching Intelligence Squared videos, participating in Model Congress debates, and forming theses for my argumentative papers. Because I've been interested in the news lately, I have decided to make a news website to voice my thoughts and opinions on such topics.

Frodo
My pup, Frodo, likes to sit on my lap while I type up my stories. Best dog ever!
My goal for this website is to inform, entertain, and educate people of all ages from around the world. I will not only cover national/world events, but also local news. Want to know what's going on in your city or state? Check The Daily Kaylee to find out! I will also post links to various websites in which I thought were useful in writing my post. Hope you enjoy!</p>
